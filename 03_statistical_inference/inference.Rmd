Statistical inference is the part of statistics that helps distinguish patterns arising from signal from those arising from chance. Statistical inference is a broad topic and here we go over the very basics using polls as a motivating example. To describe the concepts, we complement the mathematical formulas with Monte Carlo simulations and R code.

# Sampling Model Parameters and Estimates

- The task of statistical inference is to estimate an unknown population parameter using observed data from a sample.
- In a sampling model, the collection of elements in the urn is called the population.
- A parameter is a number that summarizes data for an entire population.
- A sample is observed data from a subset of the population.
- An estimate is a summary of the observed data about a parameter that we believe is informative. It is a data-driven guess of the population parameter.
- We want to predict the proportion of the blue beads in the urn, the parameter p. The proportion of red beads in the urn is 1-p and the spread is 2p-1.
- The sample proportion is a random variable. Sampling gives random results drawn from the population distribution.

# The Sample Average

- Many common data science tasks can be framed as estimating a parameter from a sample.
- We illustrate statistical inference by walking through the process to estimate p. From the estimate of p, we can easily calculate an estimate of the spread, 2p-1.
- Consider the random variable X that is 1 if a blue bead is chosen and 0 if a red bead is chosen. The proportion of blue beads in N draws is the average of the draws X1, X2 ... XN.
- ^X is the sample average. It is the average of N random draws: ^X = (X1+X2+...+XN)/N
- The number of blue beads drawn in N draws, N*^X, is N times the proportion of values in the urn. However, we do not know the true proportion: we are trying to estimate this parameter p.

# Polling vs Forecasting

- A poll taken in advance of an election estimates p for that moment, not for election day.
- In order to predict election results, forecasters try to use early estimates of p to predict p on election day. We discuss some approaches in later sections.

# Properties of Our Estimate

- ^X is a random variable with an expected value and standard error that represents the sample proportion of positive events.
- The expected value of ^X is the parameter of interest p: E[^X] = p
- As the number of N increases, the standard error of ^X decresases: SE[^X] = sqrt(p*(1-p)/N)
- In theory, we can get more accurate estimates of by increasing N. In practice, there are limits on the size of due to costs, as well as other factors we discuss later.
- We can also use other random variable equations to determine the expected value of the sum of draws E[S] and standard error of the sum of draws SE[S]: E[S] = Np; SE[S] = sqrt(Np(1-p))

# Exercises

1) Suppose you poll a population in which a proportion p of voters are Democrats and p-1 are Republicans. Your sample size is N = 25. Consider the random variable S, which is the total number of Democrats in your sample. What is the expected value of this random variable S?

E[S] = Np

2) What is the standard error of S?

SE[S] = sqrt(Np(1-p))

3) Consider the random variable S/N, which is equivalent to the sample average that we have been denoting as ^X. The variable N represents the sample size and p is the proportion of Democrats in the population. What is the expected value of?

E[^X] = p

4) What is the standard error of the sample average, ^X?

SE[^X] = sqrt(p(1-p)/N)

5) Write a line of code that calculates the standard error se of a sample average when you poll 25 people in the population. Generate a sequence of 100 proportions of Democrats p that vary from 0 (no Democrats) to 1 (all Democrats). Plot se versus p for the 100 different proportions.

```{r}
# `N` represents the number of people polled
N <- 25

# Create a variable `p` that contains 100 proportions ranging from 0 to 1 using the `seq` function
p <- seq(0,1, length = 100)

# Create a variable `se` that contains the standard error of each sample average
se <- sqrt(p * (1 - p)/N)

# Plot `p` on the x-axis and `se` on the y-axis
plot(p,se)
```

6) Using the same code as in the previous exercise, create a for-loop that generates three plots of p versus se when the sample sizes equal N = 25, N = 100, and N = 1000.

```{r}
# The vector `p` contains 100 proportions of Democrats ranging from 0 to 1 using the `seq` function
p <- seq(0, 1, length = 100)

# The vector `sample_sizes` contains the three sample sizes
sample_sizes <- c(25, 100, 1000)

# Write a for-loop that calculates the standard error `se` for every value of `p` for each of the three samples sizes `N` in the vector `sample_sizes`. Plot the three graphs, using the `ylim` argument to standardize the y-axis across all three plots.
for(N in sample_sizes){
  se <- sqrt(p*(1-p)/N)
  plot(p, se, ylim = c(0,0.5/sqrt(25)))
}
```

7) Our estimate for the difference in proportions of Democrats and Republicans is d = ^X - (1 - ^X). Which derivation correctly uses the rules we learned about sums of random variables and scaled random variables to derive the expected value of?.

E[^X - (1 - ^X)] = E[2^X -1] = 2E[^X] - 1 = 2p -1 = p - (1 - p)

8) Which derivation correctly uses the rules we learned about sums of random variables and scaled random variables to derive the standard error of d?

SE[^X - (1 - ^X)] = SE[2^X -1] = 2SE[^X] = 2sqrt(p(1-p)/N)

9) Say the actual proportion of Democratic voters is p = 0.45. In this case, the Republican party is winning by a relatively large margin of d = -0.1, or a 10% margin of victory. What is the standard error of the spread 2^X - 1 in this case?

```{r}
# `N` represents the number of people polled
N <- 25

# `p` represents the proportion of Democratic voters
p <- 0.45

# Calculate the standard error of the spread. Print this value to the console.

```
